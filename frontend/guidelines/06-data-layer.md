# 06 · Data layer & errors

> **Applies to:** anything that reads or writes server data, and anything that shows a system message.
> Files: `openapi/`, `orval.config.ts`, `src/shared/api/`, `src/shared/messages/`, `features/*/hooks/`.
> **Why it matters:** with one way to call the API and one way to show messages, every screen behaves
> the same, the types always match the backend, and MSG texts never drift from the SRS.

## 1. The pipeline

```
openapi/tsolve-api.yaml ──(npm run generate:api)──► src/shared/api/generated/   NEVER EDIT
                                                     ├── model/            types + enum constants
                                                     ├── <tag>/<tag>.ts    request functions, useX hooks, getXQueryKey
                                                     └── <tag>/<tag>.msw.ts  MSW handlers + faker data (mocks/tests only)
src/shared/api/index.ts      re-exports generated code and types + ApiError + createQueryClient
features/<f>/hooks/useX.ts   wraps a generated hook: options, invalidation, MSG toasts
features/<f>/pages/…         calls feature hooks only
```

- Server data lives **only** in the TanStack Query cache. No Redux/Zustand, no Context holding API data,
  no `useState` copies of query results.
- Pages and components import from `@/shared/api` (types) and their feature's `hooks/`. They never call
  `fetch` and never import from `@/shared/api/generated/...` directly. 🔒 (lint)

## 2. orval and regeneration

- `orval.config.ts` generates TanStack Query hooks (`client: 'react-query'`) using the native `fetch`
  transport through our wrapper `src/shared/api/http.ts` (`override.mutator`), split by OpenAPI tag
  (`mode: 'tags-split'`), plus MSW mock handlers with fake data for every endpoint. Hooks return the
  response body (`includeHttpResponseReturnType: false`), and their error type is `ApiError` (`http.ts`
  exports `ErrorType`, which orval picks up).
- `http.ts` is the only place that touches `fetch`. It adds the base URL (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`, empty = same
  origin: the Vite proxy in dev, Caddy in production), sends the session cookie, parses JSON (204 → `undefined`)
  and turns every non-2xx response — and network errors — into an `ApiError` (§6).
- Both the spec and the generated code are committed. *Why:* the app runs right after `npm ci` with no
  backend, and every API change is visible in the PR diff.

**When an endpoint changes** (one PR — DevOps design "one feature = one PR"):

1. Backend changes the controller/DTO.
2. With the backend running, `npm run api:pull` downloads its spec (springdoc,
   `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml`; other URL: `API_DOCS_URL=… npm run api:pull`) into
   `openapi/tsolve-api.yaml` — or edit the YAML by hand while the endpoint doesn't exist yet (the stub is how
   frontend work starts before the backend is ready).
3. `npm run generate:api`.
4. Fix the type errors that appear (`npm run typecheck`) — they show exactly which screens are affected.
5. Commit spec + generated code + fixes together.

Never resolve a merge conflict inside `generated/`; resolve the YAML and regenerate. (See [02](02-conflict-avoidance.md).)

## 3. Feature hooks

Wrap a generated hook in a feature hook when you add behaviour: polling, default params, invalidation,
messages. A feature hook **never reuses the generated name**: generated `useGetReviewQueue` →
feature `useReviewQueue`; generated `useApproveTickets` → feature `useApproveSelectedTickets`.
If a generated query needs nothing extra, a page may call it directly.

```ts
// features/review/hooks/useReviewQueue.ts
import { keepPreviousData } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { useGetReviewQueue, type GetReviewQueueParams } from '@/shared/api';

export const REVIEW_QUEUE_POLL_MS = 5_000; // NFR: new ticket visible within 5 s

export function useReviewQueue(params: GetReviewQueueParams) {
  return useGetReviewQueue(params, {
    query: {
      refetchInterval: REVIEW_QUEUE_POLL_MS, // pauses automatically while the tab is hidden
      placeholderData: keepPreviousData,     // no flicker when page/sort changes
    },
  });
}
```

```ts
// features/review/hooks/useReviewDecisions.ts (with useRejectSelectedTickets, useRequestChangesForTickets)
import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { getGetReviewQueueQueryKey, useApproveTickets } from '@/shared/api';
import { showMessage } from '@/shared/messages';

export function useApproveSelectedTickets() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  return useApproveTickets({
    mutation: {
      onSuccess: (result) => {
        showMessage('MSG18', { count: result.count });
        return queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: getGetReviewQueueQueryKey() });
      },
    },
  });
}
```

Names come from each `operationId` in the spec: `getReviewQueue` → `getReviewQueue()` (plain request
function), `useGetReviewQueue`, `getGetReviewQueueQueryKey`, `GetReviewQueueParams`; `approveTickets` →
`useApproveTickets`. The stub's operations today: `getMe`, `logout`, `getReviewQueue`,
`getReviewQueueTicketIds`, `approveTickets`, `rejectTickets`, `requestTicketChanges`.

## 4. Query keys, caching, invalidation

- **Keys:** always the generated `getGetXQueryKey(params?)`. Never hand-written arrays.
- **Invalidate after every successful mutation**, by the generated key of each list/detail it changes.
  Calling the key function **without params** matches every variation of that query (all pages, all
  filters) — that is what you usually want.

  | Mutation | Invalidate |
  |---|---|
  | Approve / Reject / Request changes | Review Queue, Ticket Detail of those tickets, Ticket List |
  | Unpublish / Re-publish / Send back | Ticket Detail, Ticket List, Expired Tickets, Review Queue |
  | Import finished | Import History, Ticket List |

- ❌ Never `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` with no key — it refetches the whole app.
- **Defaults** (set once in `shared/api/query-client.ts`; don't override per hook without a reason):
  `staleTime` 30 s · `gcTime` 5 min · queries retry once, except 4xx (never retried) · mutations never
  retry · refetch on window focus on.
- **No optimistic updates** in the MVP. Wait for the server, then invalidate. *Why:* simpler, and the
  NFR (confirmation within 2 s) does not need them.
- **Server-side pagination, 20 rows per page** (SRS III default). Page, size and sort go to the API as
  query params and live in the URL (see [05](05-react-components.md) C8). Spring conventions: `page` starts
  at **0** (antd's Pagination shows 1 — convert), `sort=field,asc|desc`, and a page comes back as
  `{ content: [...], page: { size, number, totalElements, totalPages } }`.

## 5. Loading, error, empty

| Flag (TanStack Query v5) | Meaning | Show |
|---|---|---|
| `isPending` | no data yet | `LoadingState` / table skeleton |
| `isError` | the request failed | `ErrorState` with retry (MSG06) — unless the global handler redirected (401/403) |
| `isFetching && !isPending` | background refetch (polling, focus) | nothing, or a subtle spinner — never blank the screen |
| data with 0 items | empty | `EmptyState` with MSG04, or the screen's code (MSG16 Review Queue) |

`ErrorState` gets its retry action from the page (`onRetry={() => void query.refetch()}`). Never call the
same query hook *inside* the error component: a new observer of a failed query refetches it on mount, the
page goes back to loading, the error component unmounts and remounts — an endless request loop.

For mutations: disable the confirm button and show its loading state while `isPending`; never allow a
double submit.

## 6. Errors and system messages (MSG codes)

### Error contract with the backend
Every error response is an RFC 9457 **Problem Details** object (Spring's `ProblemDetail`) extended with:

```json
{
  "status": 409,
  "title": "Conflict",
  "code": "MSG47",
  "params": { "department_name": "IT" },
  "fieldErrors": [{ "field": "jiraProjectKey", "code": "MSG47", "params": { "department_name": "IT" } }]
}
```

`http.ts` converts it into `ApiError { status, code: MsgCode, params, fieldErrors }` (`shared/api/errors.ts`).
`code` is always a code from our catalog: the backend's code when we know it, otherwise **MSG07** for 401,
**MSG08** for 403 and **MSG06** for everything else. A network failure is `status: 0`, `MSG06`.
*(This contract is our proposal; the backend must implement it — it is recorded in the decision log.)*

### The catalog
`src/shared/messages/catalog.ts` holds every **active** MSG code from SRS V.2 with its exact English
text and its display type. Texts are templates (`{count} ticket(s) approved and published.`).

```ts
msg('MSG02', { field_name: 'Reason', max_length: 1000 })  // → string, for field errors and inline text
showMessage('MSG18', { count: 3 })                         // → toast; level from the catalog (error if not a toast code)
await showAcknowledgement('MSG07')                         // → dialog with only OK; resolves when clicked
```

`showMessage` / `showAcknowledgement` work outside React too (the global error handler uses them):
`<MessageHost />`, rendered once by `AppProviders`, connects them to antd's App context.

✅ Do: `showMessage('MSG30')`  ❌ Don't: `message.success('Ticket unpublished.')` 🔒 (raw `message` banned)

### Where each message type is shown (SRS V.2 "Loại thông báo")

| SRS type | UI mechanism | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Red text under the field | `Form.Item` error (`rules` or server `fieldErrors`) — see [09](09-forms-and-validation.md) | MSG01, MSG02, MSG43, MSG47 |
| Shown in the page | `EmptyState` / inline `Alert` in the page | MSG04, MSG16, MSG36, MSG86 |
| Toast | `showMessage(code)` | MSG05, MSG18, MSG20, MSG38 |
| Confirm dialog | `ConfirmDialog` with the code as its text | MSG19, MSG29, MSG90, MSG92 |
| Tooltip | `Tooltip title={msg(code)}` | MSG22 |

### Who handles which error

The global part lives in `app/providers/global-errors.ts` (wired into the QueryClient by `AppProviders`).

| Error | Handled by | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| 401 on any request while signed in | global | MSG07 dialog (once, however many requests failed) → OK → cache dropped → the route guard sends the user to Login with `returnTo` |
| 401 on `GET /me` | `useSession` | not an error: nobody is signed in |
| a **query** fails (403, 404, 5xx, network) | the screen | `ErrorState` in place with `msg(error.code)` — MSG08 for 403, MSG06 for 5xx. No toast. A role that may not open the screen at all gets the 403 page from the route guard first. |
| a **mutation** fails | global | toast with `msg(error.code, error.params)` — MSG08 for 403, MSG06 for 5xx / network |
| business error with a code (4xx) on a **form** | the feature | `meta: { handlesOwnErrors: true }` + map `fieldErrors` onto the fields ([09](09-forms-and-validation.md)) |
| business error on a page action (e.g. MSG95 on Finish) | the feature | `meta: { handlesOwnErrors: true }` + show it where the SRS says (in page or toast) |

`meta: { handlesOwnErrors: true }` on a mutation turns the global toast off for it. Never show two
messages for one error. Retries: queries retry once, except 4xx (never); mutations never retry.

## 7. Session

`useSession()` (in `shared/auth`) runs the generated `GET /api/v1/me` request (`staleTime: Infinity`; 401 →
`null`) and returns `{ session, role, isPending, isError, retry, isProjectManagerOf, isMemberOf }`;
`session` is the generated `CurrentUser` (`user`, `role`, `projects` with the role in each, `departments`).
It is the only source of "who am I" — never store the user elsewhere.

`useSignOut()` calls `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`, then `resetSession()`: every other cached query and mutation
is dropped (they belong to the previous user) and the session reloads in place, so mounted guards react at
once. The expired-session flow and the dev role switcher use the same `resetSession()`.

## 8. Checklist

- [ ] No `fetch`/axios outside `shared/api/http.ts`; no imports from `generated/` paths.
- [ ] Every mutation invalidates the right generated keys and shows its MSG on success.
- [ ] Loading, error, empty handled; no blank screen during background refetch.
- [ ] Every message comes from the catalog, shown by the mechanism its SRS type requires.
- [ ] Spec + generated code + fixes committed together when the API changed.

*Last verified against code: not yet — generated names, the mutator signature and `meta` flag will be confirmed in Step 5.*
