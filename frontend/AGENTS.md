# T-Solve web app — guide for developers and AI coding agents

> **Read this file first.** It is the entry point for every person and every AI agent working in
> `frontend/`. It lists the hard rules and links to the detailed guidelines in reading order.
> `CLAUDE.md` only imports this file, so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Copilot all read the same text.

## What you are building

T-Solve (Ticket Solution Repository Application) is a knowledge layer next to Jira. Staff write a
**Solution** when they resolve a Jira issue; the **Project Manager** of that **Project** reviews it in the
**Review Queue**; **Published tickets** become searchable and are suggested back inside Jira.

This folder is the **T-Solve web app**: a React single-page app with **25 screens** for four signed-in
roles — Admin, Department Manager, Project Manager, Staff — plus the Login screen for Guests.
The T-Solve Jira App (6 screens inside Jira) is a separate app and is **not** in this folder.

Business truth lives outside the repo (SRS v2, the domain glossary, the Figma file). Everything an
agent needs from them is copied into these guidelines: screens and paths (01, 08), business words (03),
Figma kit mapping (07), system messages (`src/shared/messages/catalog.ts`).

## Stack (exact versions in `package.json`)

React 19 · TypeScript 6 (strict) · Vite 8 · Ant Design 6 · React Router 8 (data mode) ·
TanStack Query 5 · orval 8 (API client generated from OpenAPI) · MSW 3 (mocks) · Vitest 5 +
React Testing Library · ESLint 9 + Prettier · Node 24 LTS.

## Hard rules

Each rule is enforced by a tool where possible (marked 🔒). Details and examples are in the linked file.

1. **Use the glossary words exactly** — Ticket, Solution, Evidence, Published ticket, Review Queue,
   Project Manager… Never write Cluster, Defer/Deferred, Bulk sync, Knowledge article, Attachment (UI),
   Unassigned Department, or a Project filter. → [03](guidelines/03-naming.md)
2. **Import a feature only through its `index.ts`.** Never reach into another feature's folders. 🔒
   → [01](guidelines/01-project-structure.md)
3. **Never edit `src/shared/api/generated/`.** Change `openapi/tsolve-api.yaml` and run
   `npm run generate:api`. Never hand-write API types or `fetch` calls. 🔒 → [06](guidelines/06-data-layer.md)
4. **Server data lives only in TanStack Query.** No `fetch` in `useEffect`, no global store, no copying
   query data into `useState`. → [06](guidelines/06-data-layer.md)
5. **System messages come only from the MSG catalog** (`showMessage('MSG18', { count })`, `msg('MSG01', …)`).
   Never type message text yourself; MSG codes and texts are fixed by the SRS. → [06](guidelines/06-data-layer.md)
6. **Build screens from the Figma kit components in `src/shared/ui/`** plus antd primitives. Raw antd
   `Tag`, `Table`, `Modal`, `Upload` and `message` are banned outside `shared/ui`. 🔒 No hard-coded
   colours, no `style={{…}}` for layout. → [07](guidelines/07-ui-and-styling.md)
7. **TypeScript strict, no `any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no non-null `!`.** 🔒 → [04](guidelines/04-typescript.md)
8. **Every data screen handles loading, error and empty states** (empty = MSG04 unless the SRS names
   another code, e.g. MSG16 for the Review Queue). → [05](guidelines/05-react-components.md)
9. **Access is declared, not scattered:** a route lists its allowed roles; the guard does the rest.
   The backend always re-checks permissions — the UI only hides what a user cannot do.
   → [08](guidelines/08-routing-and-access.md)
10. **Do not edit `src/app/` or `src/shared/` inside a feature PR** without the FE Lead's review. The
    four registration files are pre-filled for all features — you should not need to touch them.
    🔒 (CODEOWNERS) → [02](guidelines/02-conflict-avoidance.md)
11. **No new npm dependency** without FE Lead approval and an entry in the decision log; add it in its own
    small PR. → [02](guidelines/02-conflict-avoidance.md), [13](guidelines/13-decision-log.md)
12. **Before you say "done":** `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test` must pass.
    → [11](guidelines/11-code-quality-and-tooling.md)

## npm scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server on http://localhost:5173. With `VITE_API_MOCKING=true` it runs fully on mocks. |
| `npm run build` | Type-checks and builds static files into `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Serves `dist/` locally. |
| `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` | ESLint (includes import-boundary rules). |
| `npm run format` / `format:check` | Prettier write / check. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc` with no output. |
| `npm run test` / `test:watch` | Vitest, once / in watch mode. |
| `npm run generate:api` | Regenerates the API client from `openapi/tsolve-api.yaml`. |
| `npm run api:pull` | Downloads the spec from a locally running backend into `openapi/tsolve-api.yaml`. |

## Guidelines — reading order

| # | File | Read it when… |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | [Project structure](guidelines/01-project-structure.md) | always, first |
| 02 | [Conflict avoidance & ownership](guidelines/02-conflict-avoidance.md) | always, before your first PR |
| 03 | [Naming & business vocabulary](guidelines/03-naming.md) | always |
| 04 | [TypeScript](guidelines/04-typescript.md) | writing any `.ts`/`.tsx` |
| 05 | [React components](guidelines/05-react-components.md) | writing components or pages |
| 06 | [Data layer & errors](guidelines/06-data-layer.md) | calling the API, showing messages |
| 07 | [UI & styling (Figma kit)](guidelines/07-ui-and-styling.md) | building any screen |
| 08 | [Routing & access](guidelines/08-routing-and-access.md) | adding pages, role checks |
| 09 | [Forms & validation](guidelines/09-forms-and-validation.md) | building forms or popups |
| 10 | [Testing](guidelines/10-testing.md) | writing tests |
| 11 | [Code quality & tooling](guidelines/11-code-quality-and-tooling.md) | lint/CI fails, configuring tools |
| 12 | [Workflow & PR checklist](guidelines/12-workflow.md) | starting a feature, opening a PR |
| 13 | [Decision log](guidelines/13-decision-log.md) | you want to know *why* |

**The reference implementation** is the `review` feature (Review Queue + Reject Ticket popup). When in
doubt, copy how it does things.

## Notes for AI agents

- Load `AGENTS.md` plus only the guideline files your task needs; each starts with an **Applies to** line.
- Work inside one feature folder unless the task says otherwise. If you believe `shared/` or `app/` must
  change, stop and say so instead of editing it.
- Screen names, field names, button labels, statuses and MSG texts are English and fixed by the SRS.
  If the task does not give them and they are not in these guidelines or the code, **ask** — do not invent.
- Do not add files outside the structure in [01](guidelines/01-project-structure.md).
