# 08 · Routing & access

> **Applies to:** `src/app/router/`, `src/shared/routing/`, `src/shared/auth/`, every `features/*/routes.ts`,
> and any code that shows or hides something by role.
> **Why it matters:** each role must land on its own screen, never see another role's screens, and get a
> clear 403/404 instead of a broken page. Declaring access in one place per route keeps that consistent.

## 1. Route map (all 25 web screens)

Paths live in `shared/routing/paths.ts` (pre-filled). Always use `paths.*`, never type a path string.

| # | Screen | Path | Page | Roles |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1.1 | Login | `/login` | `auth/LoginPage` | Guest |
| 1.2.1 | My Profile | `/profile` | `my-profile/MyProfilePage` | all signed-in |
| 1.3.1 | User List | `/users` | `users/UserListPage` | Admin |
| 1.3.2 | User Detail | `/users/new` · `/users/:userId` | `users/UserDetailPage` | Admin |
| 2.1 | Workspace Settings | `/workspace-settings` | `workspace/WorkspaceSettingsPage` | Admin |
| 2.2 | Department Detail | `/workspace-settings/departments/:departmentId` | `workspace/DepartmentDetailPage` | Admin |
| 2.3 | Delete Department (popup) | — | `workspace/DeleteDepartmentModal` | Admin |
| 3.1 | Jira Integration | `/jira-integration` | `jira-integration/JiraIntegrationPage` | Admin, Department Manager, Project Manager |
| 3.2 | Project Detail | `/jira-integration/projects/:projectId` | `jira-integration/ProjectDetailPage` | Project Manager |
| 5.1 | Import Tickets | `/import` (`?tab=jira\|csv\|manual`) | `ticket-import/ImportTicketsPage` | Project Manager |
| 5.2 | Import Preview | `/import/preview` | `ticket-import/ImportPreviewPage` | Project Manager |
| 5.3 | Import Ticket Preview (popup) | — | `ticket-import/ImportTicketPreviewModal` | Project Manager |
| 5.4 | Import History | `/import/history` | `ticket-import/ImportHistoryPage` | Project Manager |
| 5.5 | Ticket Detail | `/tickets/:ticketId` | `tickets/TicketDetailPage` | Staff, Project Manager, Department Manager |
| 6.1 | Search | `/search` | `search/SearchPage` | Staff, Project Manager, Department Manager |
| 6.2 | Ticket List | `/tickets` | `tickets/TicketListPage` | Staff, Project Manager, Department Manager |
| 7.1 | Review Queue | `/review-queue` | `review/ReviewQueuePage` | Project Manager |
| 7.2 | Request Changes (popup) | — | `review/RequestChangesModal` | Project Manager |
| 7.3 | Reject Ticket (popup) | — | `review/RejectTicketModal` | Project Manager |
| 7.4 | Review History | `/review-history` | `review/ReviewHistoryPage` | Project Manager |
| 7.5 | Expired Tickets | `/expired-tickets` | `review/ExpiredTicketsPage` | Project Manager |
| 8.1 | Give Feedback (popup) | — | `feedback/GiveFeedbackModal` | Staff, Project Manager, Department Manager |
| 9.1 | Knowledge Dashboard | `/dashboard` | `knowledge-dashboard/KnowledgeDashboardPage` | Department Manager, Project Manager, Admin |
| 9.2 | Audit Log | `/audit-log` | `audit-log/AuditLogPage` | Admin |
| 9.3 | Audit Entry Detail (popup) | — | `audit-log/AuditEntryDetailModal` | Admin |

Plus: `/` → landing page of the signed-in role (or `/login`); 403 is shown in place by the guard;
anything else → 404 for a signed-in user (a signed-out user is sent to `/login?returnTo=…` first) ("This page does not exist." — the SRS has no MSG code for it yet; open point).
In dev builds only: `/dev/kit`.

**Landing page per role** (SRS Screen List #1): Admin → User List · Department Manager → Knowledge
Dashboard · Project Manager → Review Queue · Staff → Search. Defined once in `shared/auth/landing.ts`.

## 2. How a feature declares its routes

We use React Router 8 in **data mode** (`createBrowserRouter`). Each feature exports a list of
`FeatureRoute`s; `app/router/routes.tsx` turns them into router objects inside the guarded shell.

```ts
// features/review/routes.ts
import { paths, type FeatureRoute } from '@/shared/routing';

export const reviewRoutes: FeatureRoute[] = [
  {
    path: paths.reviewQueue,
    title: 'Review Queue', // 7.1 — SRS screen name, shown in the header and the browser tab
    roles: ['PROJECT_MANAGER'],
    lazy: () => import('./pages/ReviewQueuePage'),
  },
  // … Review History (7.4), Expired Tickets (7.5)
];
```

- `title` is the SRS screen name; the AppShell header shows it ([07](07-ui-and-styling.md) U4).
- `roles` is **required** — the type does not compile without it. `'GUEST'` means signed-out users only
  (Login); `ALL_SIGNED_IN_ROLES` is every role (My Profile). *Why:* forgetting a guard should be
  impossible, not just unlikely.
- `lazy` loads each page's code only when it is opened (smaller first load; NFR "page loads within 2 s").
- **No route `loader`s for data.** Data is fetched by TanStack Query inside the page ([06](06-data-layer.md)).
  *Why:* one data mechanism, with caching and polling, instead of two.

## 3. Guards

```
<GuestOnly>                   (Login) a signed-in user → their landing page
<RequireAuth>                 session pending → full-page loading spinner
                              /me failed (5xx, network) → MSG06 page with "Try again"
                              no session (401) → /login?returnTo=<current path>
  <AppShell>
    <RequireRole roles=…>     role not in route.roles → ForbiddenPage (MSG08), URL unchanged
      <Page />
```

- Both guards read **only** `useSession()` ([06](06-data-layer.md) §7).
- `/login` when already signed in → redirect to the landing page.
- After sign-in the backend returns the user to `returnTo` if present, otherwise `/`.

## 4. Access inside a screen (beyond the role)

The role decides **which screens** you can open. Inside a screen, some actions also depend on the
**Project** or **Department** (Permission Matrix footnotes ¹–⁴). The backend always enforces this; the UI
only hides what you cannot do.

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| "Is the user this role?" | `const { role } = useSession(); role === 'PROJECT_MANAGER'` |
| "Is the user the Project Manager of this ticket's Project?" | `useSession().isProjectManagerOf(ticket.projectId)` |
| "Is the user a member of this Project?" | `useSession().isMemberOf(projectId)` |

```tsx
// ✅ Do — a named, testable condition
const canDecide = isProjectManagerOf(ticket.projectId);
{canDecide && <TicketDecisionActions ticket={ticket} />}

// ❌ Don't — role strings scattered through JSX, missing the Project check
{user.role === 'PROJECT_MANAGER' && <Button>Approve</Button>}
```

Data you are not allowed to see is never sent by the backend; a 403 on a page's main query shows the
403 state with MSG08 (e.g. a ticket of another Department, UC-32).

## 5. URLs as state

- Tabs, filters, sort, page number and search text live in **search params** (`?tab=csv&page=2`), read with
  `useSearchParams`. *Why:* reload, back button and shared links all work.
- Detail screens use **path params** (`/tickets/:ticketId`); read with `useParams` and handle a missing or
  invalid id with the 404 state.
- Navigate with `<Link to={paths.ticketDetail(id)}>` or `navigate(paths.reviewQueue)` — never string
  concatenation.

## 6. Popups have no route

Request Changes, Reject Ticket, Give Feedback, Import Ticket Preview, Delete Department and Audit Entry
Detail are modals opened by their parent screen with local state (`const [isRejectOpen, setRejectOpen] = useState(false)`).
*Why:* the SRS defines them as popups of a screen; a URL for each adds routes nobody bookmarks.

## 7. Leaving a screen with unsaved work

- **Import Preview** (5.2): leaving before Finish/Confirm asks **MSG92**; confirming discards everything
  (an import is never saved as a draft). Use React Router's `useBlocker` with `ConfirmDialog`, plus
  `beforeunload` for reload/close. The import data lives only in that page's memory — opening
  `/import/preview` directly (no data) redirects to `/import`.
- Other forms: no leave-confirmation unless the SRS asks for one.

## 8. Sign-in and session expiry

- **Login** has one button, "Sign in with Google". It does a full-page navigation to the backend's sign-in
  URL; the backend runs OIDC and redirects back. Errors come back as a code (`/login?error=MSG10`) and are
  shown in the Login message area (MSG10, MSG65, MSG06). *(Backend contract — decision log.)*
- **Session expired** (any 401 after sign-in): the global handler shows the **MSG07** dialog, then goes to
  `/login`. Never redirect silently.
- Open point (UI decisions 04/10): whether Login also shows MSG80/MSG82 for the Jira sign-in link. Not
  built until the FE Lead decides.

## 9. Checklist

- [ ] Route in the feature's `routes.ts` with `title`, `roles`, `paths.*` and `lazy`.
- [ ] Filters/tabs/pagination in search params; detail ids in path params with a 404 state.
- [ ] Actions hidden with named `useSession()` checks, never raw role strings in JSX.
- [ ] Popups are modals with local state.
